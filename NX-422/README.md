# NX-421: Neural Signals & Signals Processing (Professors  Dimitri Van De Ville & Silvestro Micera)
---
#### Course taken: Winter 2022 Semester

- Materials for Neural Signals & Signals Processing, Winer 2022. The course was taught in Python where we utilized the fsleyes library to visualize our raw fMRI, and other neurological datasets.

## Weekly Exercises & Mini Projects

Weekly Exercises are optional but are applied problems to help us practice the concepts being taught in the course. Mini projects are using what we learned in the weekly excercises to apply them on our data analysis pipelines of neurological data. Lastly installation contains several key files needed to run these files properly (Follow readme in that directory). 

* exercises

*side note: exercises that were skipped were due to presentation weeks (e.g. exercise5, exercise8, exercise13)*
    * exercise1 - Image Manipulation 
    * exercise2 - Preprocessing (f)MRI
    * exercise3 - Preprocessing fNIRS and dMRI
    * exercise4 - Task fMRI and GLM
    * exercise6 - Multivariate approaches
    * exercise7 - Functional connectivity, graphs and connector
    * exercise9 - EEG and MEG
    * exercise10 - EMG data preprocessing
    * exercise11 - Feature engineering
    * exercise12 - Training and validation of ML models
    * exercise14 - Simulated recordings via hybrid modelling

* installation
    * environment.yml - list of libraries needed from anaconda to set up environment for projects and exercises
    *  fslinstaller.py - run this to install the fsleyes library which visualizes brain images interactively

* mini_projects
    * mini_project1 - GLM & Facial Processing
    * mini_project2 - Multivariate Approaches
