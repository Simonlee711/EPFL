# BIO-411: Topics in Life Sciences Engineering (Brian McCabe, Pierre GÃ¶nczy, Felix Naef)
#### Course taken: Winter 2022 Semester

- Materials from the Topics in life sciences engineering, Winer 2022. Primarily we did writing assignments in this class but project three contains some computational work as well

## Three mini projects

The course was divided into three modules taught by the three professors. The class covered a lot of methods in the current field of genetics and genetic engineering and below we list the three projects conducted throughout the semester

- Module 1: Genomes and methods for Manipulating genomes
- Module 2: Genetic Screens (Forward Genetics, functional genetics, synthetic lethal screens, chemical screens)
- Module 3: Gene Expression and Chronobiology
