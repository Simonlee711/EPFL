# BIO-322: Machine Learning for Bioengineers (in Julia) (Dr. Johanni Brea)
---
#### Course taken: Winter 2022 Semester

- Materials for Machine Learning for Bioengineers, Winer 2022. The course was taught in Julia due to its recent advances in scientific computing and its computational speed.

## Weekly Exercises

Weekly Exercises are optional but are conceptual and applied problems to help us practice the concepts being taught in the course. I have organized my code and math in Jupyter notebooks taking advantage of writing latex for any mathematical reasoning while adding a annotated notebook with my code.
